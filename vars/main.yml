# vars file for tomee
#
# In the defaults/main.yml we already have defaults set for:
#
# tomee_binary                  tomee_dirname
# tomee_install_dir             catalina_home
# tomee_owner                   tomee_group
# jvm_name                      catalina_base
#
# They can be overridden here to take effect for all instances of
# this role.
#
# Examples:
# tomee_binary: "apache-tomee-8.0.12-webprofile.tar.gz"
# tomee_dirname: "tomee8"
# tomee_install_dir: "/opt/apache"
